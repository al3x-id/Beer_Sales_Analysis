## Conclusion
The Brewery Retailer Dashboard provides clear evidence of significant growth in sales, units sold, and profitability between 2022 and 2023. With over ₦3.4 billion in total sales, 2 million+ units sold, and strong performance from both top retailers like Shoprite and leading beer brands like Trophy, the business is on a strong upward trajectory.

Regional insights reveal that the northern zones dominate sales, while quarterly trends highlight Q3 as the most lucrative period. Although performance has improved across the board, profit margin optimization and targeted support for lower-performing retailers and brands remain opportunities for strategic improvement.
